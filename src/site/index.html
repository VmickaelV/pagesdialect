        <h1>PagesDialect for Thymeleaf</h1>
        <p>
            PagesDialect is a custom dialect for the <a href="http://www.thymeleaf.org">Thymeleaf template engine</a>.
            It provides some Collection processing utilities, like pagination, sorting or exporting.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note:</b> these utilities work with the full Collection object in memory. This could be not  
            a good idea if you have a table with thousands of rows, but it is pretty nice for a
            bunch of simple applications.
